  "description": "Change the multiplier of a honeybee Room.\n_\nMultipliers are used to speed up the calculation when similar Rooms are\nrepeated more than once. Essentially, a given simulation with the\nRoom is run once and then the result is multiplied by the multiplier.\nThis means that the \"repetition\" isn't in a particular direction (it's\nessentially in the exact same location) and this comes with some\ninaccuracy. However, this error might not be too large if the Rooms\nare similar enough and it can often be worth it since it can greatly\nspeed up the calculation.\n-"
