  "description": "Simplify the Apertures assigned to Honeybee Rooms or Faces to be as few as\npossible while still maintaining approximately the same overall Aperture area.\n_\nBy default, this component will only simplify Apertures in convex Faces by \nreducing them to a ratio represented with one or two clean Apertures.\nFor models without many concave Faces, this process usually produces a\nfast-simulating result that matches the original window area exactly. However,\nthis operation will also change the placement of Apertures within a Face,\nwhich may make it unsuitable for modeling the impact of Shades on Apertures\nor for evaluating daylight.\n_\nFor cases with concave Faces (which is typical for Roofs/Skylights) or when it\nis desirable to keep Apertures in the same location within the parent Face,\nthe Apertures can be simplified by specifying a merge_dist_, which will join\ntogether Apertures in close proximity to one another rather than reducing\nthem to a ratio.\n-"
