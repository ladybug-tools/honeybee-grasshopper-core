"""
Separate the faces/sub-faces of honeybee Rooms, Faces, Apertures or Doors by
boundary condition.
-

    Args:
        _hb_objs: Honeybee Rooms, Faces, Apertures, Doors and/or Shades which will
            be separated based on object and face type.
    
    Returns:
        outdoors: The faces with an Outdoors boundary condition.
        surface: The faces with a Surface (interior) boundary condition.
        ground: The faces with a Ground boundary condition.
        adiabatic: The faces with an adiabatic (no heat flow) boundary condition.
        other: All faces with a boundary condition other than the four above.
