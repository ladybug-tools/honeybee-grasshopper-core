"""
Move any Honeybee geometry object or a Model object along a vector.
-

    Args:
        _hb_objs: Any Honeybee geometry object (eg. Room, Face, Aperture, Door or
            Shade) to be moved along the input vector. This can also be a Honeybee
            Model object to be moved.
        _vector: A Vector3D with the direction and distance to move the _hb_objs.
        prefix_: Optional text string that will be inserted at the start of the
            identifiers and display names of all transformed objects, their child
            objects, and their adjacent Surface boundary condition objects. This
            is particularly useful in workflows where you duplicate and edit a
            starting object and then want to combine it with the original object
            into one Model (like making a model of repeated rooms) since all
            objects within a Model must have unique identifiers. It is recommended
            that this prefix be short to avoid maxing out the 100 allowable
            characters for honeybee identifiers. If None, no prefix will be
            added to the input objects and all identifiers and display names
            will remain the same. Default: None.
    
    Returns:
        hb_objs: The input _hb_objs that has been moved along the input vector.
