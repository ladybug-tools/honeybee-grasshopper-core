"""
Dump any honeybee object to a JSON file. You can use "HB Load Objects" component
to load the objects from the file back into Grasshopper.
-
Honeybee objects include any Model, Room, Face, Aperture, Door, Shade, or
boundary condition object
-
It also includes any honeybee energy Material, Construction, ConstructionSet,
Schedule, Load, ProgramType, or Simulation object.
-

    Args:
        _hb_objs: A list of Honeybee objects to be written to a file.
        _name_: A name for the file to which the honeybee objects will be
            written. (Default: 'unnamed').
        _folder_: An optional directory into which the honeybee objects will be
            written.  The default is set to the default simulation folder.
        indent_: An optional positive integer to set the indentation used in the
            resulting JSON file.
        abridged_: Set to "True" to serialize the object in its abridged form.
            Abridged objects cannot be reserialized back to honeybee objects
            on their own but they are used throughout honeybee to minimize
            file size and unnecessary duplication.
        _dump: Set to "True" to save the honeybee objects to file.

    Returns:
        report: Errors, warnings, etc.
        hb_file: The location of the file where the honeybee JSON is saved.
