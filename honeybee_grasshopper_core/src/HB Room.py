Create Honeybee Room from Honeybee Faces.
_
Note that each Room is mapped to a single zone in EnergyPlus/OpenStudio and
should always be a closed volume to ensure correct volumetric calculations and
avoid light leaks in Radiance simulations.
-

    Args:
        _faces: A list of honeybee Faces to be joined together into a Room.
        _name_: Text to set the name for the Room and to be incorporated into
            unique Room identifier. If the name is not provided, a random name
            will be assigned.
        _mod_set_: Text for the modifier set of the Room, which is used
            to assign all default radiance modifiers needed to create a radiance
            model. Text should refer to a ModifierSet within the library) such
            as that output from the "HB List Modifier Sets" component. This
            can also be a custom ModifierSet object. If nothing is input here,
            the Room will have a generic construction set that is not sensitive to
            the Room's climate or building energy code.
        _constr_set_: Text for the construction set of the Room, which is used
            to assign all default energy constructions needed to create an energy
            model. Text should refer to a ConstructionSet within the library) such
            as that output from the "HB List Construction Sets" component. This
            can also be a custom ConstructionSet object. If nothing is input here,
            the Room will have a generic construction set that is not sensitive to
            the Room's climate or building energy code.
        _program_: Text for the program of the Room (to be looked up in the ProgramType
            library) such as that output from the "HB List Programs" component.
            This can also be a custom ProgramType object. If no program is input
            here, the Room will have a generic office program. Note that ProgramTypes
            effectively map to OpenStudio space types upon export to OpenStudio.
        conditioned_: Boolean to note whether the Room has a heating and cooling
            system.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        room: Honeybee room. These can be used directly in energy and radiance
            simulations.
