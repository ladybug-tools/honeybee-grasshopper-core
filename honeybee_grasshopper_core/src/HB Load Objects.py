Load any honeybee object from a honeybee JSON file
-
Honeybee objects include any Model, Room, Face, Aperture, Door, Shade, or
boundary condition object.

It also includes any honeybee energy Material, Construction, ConstructionSet,
Schedule, Load, ProgramType, or Simulation object.

        _hb_file: A file path to a honeybee JSON from which objects will be loaded
            back into Grasshopper. The objects in the file must be non-abridged

    Returns:
        hb_objs: A list of honeybee objects that have been re-serialized from
            the input file.
