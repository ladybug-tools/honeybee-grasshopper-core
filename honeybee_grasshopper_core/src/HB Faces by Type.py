"""
Separate the faces/sub-faces of honeybee Rooms, Faces, Apertures, Doors, or Shades
by object and face type.
-

    Args:
        _hb_objs: Honeybee Rooms, Faces, Apertures, Doors and/or Shades which will be
            separated based on object and face type. This can also be an entire
            honeybee Model.

    Returns:
        walls:The Walls with an Outdoors or Ground boundary condition.
        interior_walls: The Walls with a Surface or Adiabatic boundary condition.
        roofs: The RoofCeilings with an Outdoors or Ground boundary condition.
        ceilings: The RoofCeilings with a Surface or Adiabatic boundary condition.
        exterior_floors: The Floors with an Outdoors or Ground boundary condition.
        interior_floors: The Floors with a Surface or Adiabatic boundary condition.
        air_walls: The AirWalls.
        apertures: The Apertures with an Outdoors boundary condition.
        interior_apertures: The Apertures with a Surface boundary condition.
        doors: The Doors with an Outdoors boundary condition.
        interior_doors: The Doors with a Surface boundary condition.
        outdoor_shades: The Shades assigned to the outdoors of their parent objects.
            This also includes all orphaned shades of a model.
        indoor_shades: The Shades assigned to the indoors of their parent objects.
