"""
Add louverd Shades, overhangs or fins to all the outdoor Apertures of an input
Room, Face or Aperture.
_
Note that, if a Face or Room is input, Shades will only be added to those Faces
that are Walls (not Floors or Roofs).
-

    Args:
        _hb_objs: A list of honeybee Rooms, Faces, or Apertures to which louver
            shades will be added.
        _depth: A number for the depth to extrude the louvers. If an array of values
            are input here, different depths will be assigned based on
            cardinal direction, starting with north and moving clockwise.
        _shade_count_: A positive integer for the number of louvers to generate.
            If there is an input below for _dist_between_, an attempt will
            still be made to meet the _shade_count_ but, if there are more
            shades than can fit on the input hb_obj, the number of shades
            will be truncated. If an array of values are input here, different
            shade counts will be assigned based on cardinal direction, starting
            with north and moving clockwise. (Default: 1).
        _dist_between_: A number for the approximate distance between each louver.
            If an array of values are input here, different distances between
            louvers will be assigned based on cardinal direction, starting
            with north and moving clockwise.
        _facade_offset_: A number for the distance from the louver edge to the
            facade. If an array of values are input here, different offsets will
            be assigned based on cardinal direction, starting with north and
            moving clockwise. (Default: 0).
        _angle_: A number for the for an angle to rotate the louvers in degrees.
            If an array of values are input here, different angles will be
            assigned based on cardinal direction, starting with north and moving
            clockwise. (Default: 0).
        vertical_: Optional boolean to note whether the lovers are vertical. If False,
            the louvers will be horizontal. If an array of values are input
            here, different vertical booleans will be assigned based on cardinal
            direction, starting with north and moving clockwise. (Default: False).
        flip_start_: Optional boolean to note whether the side the louvers start
            from should be flipped. If False, louvers will be generated starting
            on top or the right side. If True, louvers will start from the
            bottom or left. If an array of values are input here, different
            flip start booleans will be assigned based on cardinal direction,
            starting with north and moving clockwise. Default: False.
        indoor_: Optional boolean for whether louvers should be generated facing the
            opposite direction of the aperture normal and added to the Aperture's
            indoor_shades instead of outdoor_shades. If an array of values are
            input here, different indoor booleans will be assigned based on
            cardinal direction, starting with north and moving clockwise.
            Note that, by default, indoor shades are not used in energy simulations
            but they are used in all simulations involving Radiance. (Default: False).
        ep_constr_: Optional Honeybee ShadeConstruction to be applied to the input _hb_objs.
            This can also be text for a construction to be looked up in the shade
            construction library. If an array of text or construction objects
            are input here, different constructions will be assigned based on
            cardinal direction, starting with north and moving clockwise.
        rad_mod_: Optional Honeybee Modifier to be applied to the input _hb_objs.
            This can also be text for a modifier to be looked up in the shade
            modifier library. If an array of text or modifier objects
            are input here, different modifiers will be assigned based on
            cardinal direction, starting with north and moving clockwise.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        hb_objs: The input Honeybee Face or Room or Aperture with louvered shades
            added to it.
