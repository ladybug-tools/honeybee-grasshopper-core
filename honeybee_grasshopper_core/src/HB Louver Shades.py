"""
Add louverd Shades, overhangs or fins to all the outdoor Apertures of an input
Room, Face or Aperture.
_
Note that, if a Face or Room is input, Shades will only be added to those Faces
that are Walls (not Floors or Roofs).
-

    Args:
        _hb_objs: A list of honeybee Rooms, Faces, or Apertures to which louver
            shades will be added.
        _depth: A number for the depth to extrude the louvers. If an array of values
            are input here, different depths will be assigned based on
            cardinal direction, starting with north and moving clockwise.
        _shade_count_: A positive integer for the number of louvers to generate.
            Note that this input should be None if there is an input for
            _dist_between_. If an array of values are input here, different
            shade counts will be assigned based on cardinal direction, starting
            with north and moving clockwise. Default: 1.
        _dist_between_: A number for the approximate distance between each louver.
            Note that this input should be None if there is an input for
            _shade_count_. If an array of values are input here, different
            distances between louvers will be assigned based on cardinal
            direction, starting with north and moving clockwise.
        _facade_offset_: A number for the distance from the louver edge to the
            facade. If an array of values are input here, different offsets will
            be assigned based on cardinal direction, starting with north and
            moving clockwise. Default: 0.
        _angle_: A number for the for an angle to rotate the louvers in degrees.
            If an array of values are input here, different angles will be
            assigned based on cardinal direction, starting with north and moving
            clockwise. Default: 0.
        vertical_: Optional boolean to note whether the lovers are vertical.
            If False, the louvers will be horizontal. If an array of values are
            input here, different vertical booleans will be assigned based on
            cardinal direction, starting with north and moving clockwise.
            Default: False.
        flip_start_: Optional boolean to note whether the side the louvers start
            from should be flipped. If False, louvers will be generated starting
            on top or the right side. If True, louvers will start contours from
            the bottom or left. If an array of values are input here, different
            flip start booleans will be assigned based on cardinal direction,
            starting with north and moving clockwise. Default: False.
        indoor_: Optional boolean for whether louvers should be generated facing the
            opposite direction of the aperture normal and added to the Aperture's
            indoor_shades instead of outdoor_shades. If an array of values are
            input here, different indoor booleans will be assigned based on
            cardinal direction, starting with north and moving clockwise.
            Note that, by default, indoor shades are not used in energy simulations
            but they are used in all simulations involving Radiance. Default: False.
    
    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        hb_objs: The input Honeybee Face or Room or Aperture with louvered shades
            added to it.
