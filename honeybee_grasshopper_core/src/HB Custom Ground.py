"""
Set the boundary conditions of Rooms to be Ground vs. Outdoors using a surface or
polysurface that represents the ground.
_
Room faces that are coplanar with the ground surface or have a center below it
will get a Ground boundary condition. Existing Faces with a Surface/Adiabatic
condition, AirBoundary type, or assigned Apertures/Doors will be unaffected.
_
Note that this component will not intersect the Faces with the ground surface and
this is intersection should be done prior to the creation of the Honeybee Rooms.
-

    Args:
        _rooms: Honeybee Rooms which will have their Face boundary conditions set
            based on their spatial relation to the _ground geometry below.
        _ground: Rhino Breps or Meshes that represent the Ground.
        reset_: A Boolean to note whether the _ground geometry simply adds additional
            ground boundary conditions to the _rooms (False) or it resets
            all existing ground boundary conditions to only exist at or below
            the _ground geometry (True). (Default: False).

    Returns:
        rooms: The input Rooms with their Ground boundary conditions set.
