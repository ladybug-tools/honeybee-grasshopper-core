"""
Dump any honeybee object to a compressed .pkl file. You can use "HB Load Compressed
Objects" component to load the objects from the file back into Grasshopper.
-
Honeybee objects include any Model, Room, Face, Aperture, Door, Shade, or
boundary condition object
-
It also includes any honeybee energy Material, Construction, ConstructionSet,
Schedule, Load, ProgramType, or Simulation object.
-

    Args:
        _hb_objs: A Honeybee object (or list of Honeybee objects) to be written
            to a file.
        _name_: A name for the file to which the honeybee objects will be
            written. (Default: 'unnamed').
        _folder_: An optional directory into which the honeybee objects will be
            written.  The default is set to the default simulation folder.
        _dump: Set to "True" to save the honeybee objects to file.

    Returns:
        report: Errors, warnings, etc.
        hb_file: The location of the file where the honeybee .pkl file is saved.
