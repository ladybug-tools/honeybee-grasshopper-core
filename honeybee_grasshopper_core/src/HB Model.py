"""
Create a Honeybee Model, which can be sent for simulation.
-

    Args:
        rooms_: A list of honeybee Rooms to be added to the Model. Note that at
            least one Room is necessary to make a simulate-able energy model.
        faces_: A list of honeybee Faces to be added to the Model. Note that
            faces without a parent Room are not allowed for energy models.
        shades_: A list of honeybee Shades to be added to the Model.
        apertures_: A list of honeybee Apertures to be added to the Model. Note
            that apertures without a parent Face are not allowed for energy models.
        doors_: A list of honeybee Doors to be added to the Model. Note
            that doors without a parent Face are not allowed for energy models.
        _name_: Text to be used for the Model name and to be incorporated into a unique
            model identifier. If no name is provided, it will be "unnamed" and
            a unique model identifier will be auto-generated.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        model: A Honeybee Model object possessing all of the input geometry
            objects.
